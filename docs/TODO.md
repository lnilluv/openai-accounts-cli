# TODO

## Pooling

- [ ] Add custom pool creation and management commands.
  - Proposed commands: `oa pool create`, `oa pool add`, `oa pool remove`, `oa pool list`.
  - Goal: support separate pools for contexts like personal vs pro/team accounts and quick switching between those pools.
  - Include behavior for selecting the active pool in `oa run` and `oa usage` views.
